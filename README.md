# IPCA-Replication
This repository contains a methodological replication of the paper "Characteristics are Covariances: A Unified Model of Risk and Return" (Kelly, Pruitt, &amp; Su, 2019, JFE). It provides Python scripts to reproduce Tables I and II using the original time-series stock data, illustrating the key empirical results and methodology.
